Transactions are the way HaltH combines funding and payments. A transaction can be initiated for a booking or standalone.

## Funding

### Private health insurance

When transactions involve PHI funding, we first submit a claim to the relevant insurer to confirm the rebate amount.
We can then request a confirmation from the client to approve the claim.
Finally, the claim can be confirmed and the gap payment is processed.
