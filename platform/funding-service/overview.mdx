title: "Creating a funding quote"
---

The funding quote process enables two key functions:

- Clients can estimate their out-of-pocket expenses before booking an appointment
- Healthcare providers can confirm funding and calculate gap payments after a service has been completed.

## Create a Health Fund Card

The first step in the funding quote process is to create a digital representation of the patient's health fund card. This digital card serves as the foundation for all subsequent funding-related operations. The health fund card creation process requires specific member information to ensure accurate coverage verification.

To create a health fund card, make a POST request to the [Health Fund Cards endpoint](/api-reference/health-fund-cards/create-health-fund-card).

The system will validate the provided information and create a secure digital representation of the health fund card. Upon successful creation, you'll receive a unique identifier that you'll need for subsequent quote requests.

## Submit Quote Request

Once you have created the health fund card, you can proceed with submitting a quote request. This step involves providing detailed information about the services being claimed and the patient's context. The quote request will return coverage details and estimated out-of-pocket expenses.

To submit a quote request, make a request to the [Funding Quotes endpoint](/api-reference/quotes/create-funding-quote).
