A member is any user on the HaltH platform.

Bookings can be made without signing into HaltH, however, we require members to verify their mobile number before managing their appointments.

Members can easily sign in with a one-time password sent to their mobile number. All bookings linked to their mobile number will be made available for viewing and management.
