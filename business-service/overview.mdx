title: "Creating a booking"
---

The booking process consists of three simple steps: retrieving booking data, checking availability, and creating the booking.

## Get Booking Data

Retrieve essential information about a clinic such as locations, providers, appointment types using the [Get Booking Data](/api-reference/booking-data/get-booking-data) endpoint.

## Check Availability

Use the [Check Availability](/api-reference/availability/get-availability) endpoint to find suitable appointment slots. This endpoint searches for open time slots based on your criteria and returns a list of available dates and times.

## Create Booking

The [Create Booking](/api-reference/bookings/create-booking) endpoint confirms the appointment by creating a new booking and syncing it into the provider's patient management system.

## PMS Integration

HaltH sets up a bi-directional sync with the provider's patient management system.

We currently support the following patient managment systems:

- Cliniko
- Nookal

Once the integration is configured, we will frequently sync locations, providers, appointment types, and bookings.
HaltH will also write new clients and bookings into the PMS via API.
