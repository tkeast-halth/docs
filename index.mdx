# Creating a Funding Quote

The funding quote process enables healthcare providers to verify patient coverage and estimate out-of-pocket expenses before providing services. This process involves two key steps: creating a health fund card and submitting a quote request. Each step is essential for ensuring accurate coverage verification and cost estimation.

## Create a Health Fund Card

The first step in the funding quote process is to create a digital representation of the patient's health fund card. This digital card serves as the foundation for all subsequent funding-related operations. The health fund card creation process requires specific member information to ensure accurate coverage verification.

To create a health fund card, make a POST request to the [Health Fund Cards endpoint](/api-reference/health-fund-cards/create-health-fund-card).

The system will validate the provided information and create a secure digital representation of the health fund card. Upon successful creation, you'll receive a unique identifier that you'll need for subsequent quote requests.

## Submit Quote Request

Once you have created the health fund card, you can proceed with submitting a quote request. This step involves providing detailed information about the services being claimed and the patient's context. The quote request will return coverage details and estimated out-of-pocket expenses.

To submit a quote request, make a GET request to the [Funding Quotes endpoint](/api-reference/funding/get-funding-quote).

### Quote Request Components

A quote request requires three main components:

1. **Service Provider Information**

   - Location identifier
   - Provider identifier
   - These ensure the quote is specific to the correct healthcare provider and location

2. **Transaction Items**

   - Detailed list of services being claimed
   - Each service should include:
     - Item code
     - Description
     - Charge amount
   - Multiple services can be included in a single quote request

3. **Private Health Insurance Details**
   - Health fund card identifier (from Step 1)
   - Patient reference number
   - Location information for coverage verification

## Health Fund Integration

The system supports integration with all major Australian health funds. To view the complete list of supported health funds and their identifiers, make a GET request to the [Health Funds endpoint](/api-reference/health-funds/get-health-funds).
